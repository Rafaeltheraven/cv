  abstract = {In this work we present a system that generates reports for a game of Risk. These reports, far from being “neutral”, aim instead at mimicking propaganda, and try to influence the opinions of the readers about the performance of a Risk player. The system, while limited in scope, was able to persuade some test subjects in a qualitative evaluation, hinting at the abilities that a more sophisticated system might have.},
