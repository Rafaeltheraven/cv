  abstract = {In this work we present a system that generates reports for a game of Risk. These reports, far from being “neutral”, aim instead at mimicking propaganda, and try to influence the opinions of the readers about the performance of a Risk player. The system, while limited in scope, was able to persuade some test subjects in a qualitative evaluation, hinting at the abilities that a more sophisticated system might have.},

        abstract = {Weighted Attribute Grammars (WAGs) are an emerging field of study and have been used for a variety of different tasks. However, due to the as-of-now obscure nature of the field, researchers are left to re-invent the wheel every time, having to implement a WAG parser before they can start the interesting part of their research. This paper proposes the creation of a standardized Domain Specific Language (DSL) to define WAGs, as well as a workbench to facilitate working with this DSL and a parser generator that functions as a
business case.}
